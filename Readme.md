# Learning ASP.NET Identity

This project contains what I have learnt in ASP.NET Identity. I came across Identity when I was searching if dotnetcore had an inbuilt mechanism for hashing passwords.

I plan to cover the following topics
- [x] User Registering and Sign In
- [x] User Roles
- [ ] User Sign Out

Currently I have used the following links to learn
